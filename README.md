My name is Andrew Gurung and I am a software developer based in Maryland, USA. I help clients build products that make the world better. I have experience working with the entire stack, but my passion is on front-end. I find the fast-pace of front-end development to be a challenge, one that has me continually learning.

Technologies I love playing with include; [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), Java, Javascript (passionate about ES6) and [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

When Iâ€™m not programming, you can find me strength training, fishing or trying my hands on photography.

I like to write mostly about software development related things. I also post my experience learning new technology, languages, libraries and frameworks (you name it).

If you like my website, you can follow me on twitter [@andrewgurung](https://twitter.com/andrewgurung).
